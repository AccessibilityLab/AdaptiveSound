This is an alpha version of AdaptiveSound and is still undergoing internal testing. Please bear with us as we update this page with new updates ðŸ˜ƒ

## Introduction

AdaptiveSound represents an innovative Android application specifically crafted to offer a groundbreaking solution for people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH). Diverging from traditional systems relying on pre-trained models from generic datasets, AdaptiveSound introduces a real-time system that empowers users to actively provide corrective feedback. This distinctive feature enables the application to dynamically adjust to the varied acoustic environments encountered by individuals with DHH.

Operating within a reinforcement learning framework, the sound classification model embedded in AdaptiveSound can autonomously update in response to user feedback, facilitating continual adaptive enhancement over time. This seamless integration allows AdaptiveSound to achieve adaptive sound recognition with minimal effort from end-users.

## File Structure

`android`: the android app that can do sound classification and adaptively fine-tuned in the user's environment.
`tensorflow`: the tf-lite model training and generation code

## Model Setup

Please download the sound classification model file through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-c7_m_i7v73OfGobqQYhIIncF2AOJugs/view?usp=share_link) or train your own model following the notebook in the  `tensorflow` directory. The model file should be stored in the path `android/app/src/main/assets/sc_model.tflite`.
